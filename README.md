# Scope3 Interview Kit

A CLI tool for interacting with the Measure API. This tool provides commands for measuring and analyzing data through a simple command-line interface.

All CLI implementations use the Scope3 Measure API, you can find the documentation here: https://docs.scope3.com/reference/measure-1

## Language Options

You may complete this exercise using any of the following programming languages:

- [Go](./go/README.md)
- [Python](./python/README.md)
- [TypeScript](./typescript/README.md)

## Set Up

1. Choose one of the supported programming languages above
2. Follow the setup and implementation instructions in the corresponding README file for your chosen language

## FAQ

### Which programming language should I choose?
Choose the language you're most comfortable with from the available options (Go, Python, or TypeScript). The evaluation will focus on your problem-solving skills and code quality rather than language-specific features.

### What development tools am I allowed to use?
You are welcome to use all the development tools you would typically have available during your normal workday. This includes your preferred IDE, debugging tools, and other development utilities.

While AI assistants and LLMs (like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot) are valuable tools in modern development, please refrain from using them to solve the core problems in this exercise. We want to evaluate your problem-solving approach, coding style, and technical decision-making abilities firsthand. You may use them for reference purposes, such as looking up language syntax or understanding library documentation, but not for generating solution code or problem-solving logic.

### Can I use additional libraries?
Yes, you can use any standard libraries or common third-party packages that would help you complete the task efficiently. Just make sure to document any dependencies in your implementation's README.
